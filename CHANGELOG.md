# Changelog

## 1.0.0

- New Debug section in Settings. Debug mode shows a live log on the main screen.
- Run diagnostics checks your network, DNS, every test site and the engine, and explains each problem in plain words: DNS blocking, connection resets, timeouts, certificate errors, a VPN or another proxy in the way, Kaspersky, or another DPI tool.
- The DNS check compares your provider's DNS with secure DNS and flags fake or blocked answers.
- The site check measures DNS, TCP and HTTPS step by step, directly and through FreeDPI, so you can tell a DPI block from a site that is down.
- Copy the diagnostics report or save it as a file. Your local address is masked.
- The log now records every setting tried, how long it took and why a test site failed.

## 0.1.19

- Updates show up without restarting FreeDPI: it checks every 30 minutes and every time you open the window.
- New After VPN setting: when a VPN or a network change breaks the connection, FreeDPI reconnects on its own once the VPN is turned off or the network changes again. On by default.

## 0.1.18

- Linux support with .deb and AppImage packages.
- On Linux, FreeDPI sets the GNOME and KDE system proxy and shows the proxy address for other apps.

## 0.1.17

- Turn notifications on or off under Settings > Notifications.
